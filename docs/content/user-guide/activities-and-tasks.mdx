title: Activities & Tasks
description: Track all sales activities and manage your task list to stay on top of follow-ups.

Activities and tasks are central to keeping your sales process organized. Activities represent things that have happened (calls made, emails sent, meetings held), while tasks represent things that need to happen (follow-ups, to-dos, scheduled actions). Together, they ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

## Tasks

### Tasks Page

Navigate to **Tasks** from the left sidebar to see your complete task list. The page opens with a header and four summary statistic cards:

- **Total Tasks** -- The total number of tasks in your system.
- **Completed** -- How many tasks have been marked as done.
- **Overdue** -- Tasks past their due date that have not been completed.
- **High Priority** -- The number of incomplete tasks marked as high priority.

### Searching Tasks

Use the search bar at the top of the page to find tasks by subject or description. Results filter in real time.

### Filtering Tasks

Click the **Filters** button to expand the filter panel. You can filter by:

**Status:**

- **All** -- Show all tasks.
- **Not Started** -- Tasks that have not been begun.
- **In Progress** -- Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Waiting** -- Tasks blocked or waiting on someone else.
- **Completed** -- Finished tasks.

An additional status, **Deferred**, is available for tasks that have been postponed.

**Priority:**

- **All** -- Show all priorities.
- **High** -- Urgent tasks that should be addressed first.
- **Normal** -- Standard priority tasks.
- **Low** -- Tasks that can wait.

Filters can be combined. For example, you can view only high-priority tasks that are not started.

### Task Grouping

Tasks are automatically grouped into two sections on the page:

- **Pending** -- All tasks that are not yet completed (Not Started, In Progress, Waiting, Deferred). This section appears first and shows the count.
- **Completed** -- All tasks that have been finished. Completed tasks are displayed with reduced opacity and a strikethrough on the subject line.

### Task Cards

Each task is displayed as a card with:

- **Completion checkbox** -- Click the circle on the left to mark a task as completed. A green checkmark appears for completed tasks.
- **Subject** -- The task title, displayed prominently.
- **Description** -- Additional detail about the task, shown below the subject (truncated to two lines).
- **Priority flag** -- A colored flag icon indicating High (gold), Normal (gray), or Low (light gray) priority.
- **Status badge** -- Shows the current status (Not Started, In Progress, Waiting, Completed).
- **Type icon** -- An icon indicating the task type: phone (Call), envelope (Email), people (Meeting), arrow (Follow Up), or circle (Other).
- **Due date** -- Displayed as "Today," "Tomorrow," or the calendar date. Overdue dates are shown in red with an alert icon.
- **Related record link** -- If the task is linked to a lead, contact, or opportunity, a gold link appears that you can click to navigate to that record.

### Completing a Task

To mark a task as complete, click the **circle checkbox** on the left side of the task card. The task will move to the Completed section with a success notification. Completed tasks cannot be uncompleted from this view.

## Creating Tasks

### Creating Tasks from the Tasks Page

Click the **New Task** button in the top-right corner to open the Create New Task modal. Fill in the following fields:

- **Subject** (required) -- A clear, concise title for the task.
- **Description** -- Additional context or instructions.
- **Type** -- Select the type of task:
  - **Call** -- A phone call to make.
  - **Email** -- An email to send.
  - **Meeting** -- A meeting to attend or schedule.
  - **Follow Up** -- A general follow-up action.
  - **Other** -- Any other type of task.
- **Priority** -- Set to High, Normal, or Low.
- **Due Date** -- When the task should be completed by.

Click **Create Task** to save.

### Creating Tasks from Other Records

Tasks can also be created in context from other parts of SalesOS:

- **From a deal detail page** -- Use the Quick Log Activity feature to create follow-up tasks linked to the deal.
- **From a lead or contact detail page** -- Activities and tasks created here are automatically linked to that record.
- **From the dashboard** -- Action items on the dashboard often link to tasks that need attention.

When a task is created from another record, it is automatically linked to that record (lead, contact, or opportunity), and a link back to the source record appears on the task card.

## Task Fields Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Subject | Yes | The task title |
| Description | No | Additional details or instructions |
| Type | No | Call, Email, Meeting, Follow Up, or Other |
| Priority | No | High, Normal, or Low (defaults to Normal) |
| Status | Auto | Not Started, In Progress, Waiting, Deferred, or Completed |
| Due Date | No | The target completion date |
| Linked Record | Auto | The lead, contact, or opportunity this task relates to |

## Activity Tracking Across the Platform

Activities in SalesOS represent interactions that have occurred with leads, contacts, accounts, and deals. Unlike tasks (which are forward-looking), activities are a historical record of what has happened.

### Types of Activities

SalesOS tracks the following types of activities:

- **Calls Logged** -- Records of phone calls, including duration and notes.
- **Emails Sent** -- Email interactions tracked through the platform.
- **Meetings Held** -- Meetings that have taken place, including attendees and notes.
- **Notes** -- Freeform notes added to records.
- **Stage Changes** -- When a deal moves from one stage to another.
- **Status Updates** -- When a lead or task status changes.

### Logging Activities

Activities can be logged in several ways:

1. **Quick Log Activity** -- Available on deal detail pages, this feature lets you quickly record a call, email, meeting, or note without leaving the page.
2. **Automatic tracking** -- Certain actions are tracked automatically, such as deal stage changes, lead status updates, and task completions.
3. **From record detail pages** -- Lead, contact, account, and deal detail pages all include the ability to add activities.

## Activity Timeline

The activity timeline is a chronological feed of all interactions and events related to a record. It appears on detail pages for leads, contacts, accounts, and deals.

### What the Timeline Shows

The timeline includes:

- **Logged calls** with notes and duration.
- **Sent emails** with subject and content preview.
- **Meetings** with attendees and agenda.
- **Notes** added by team members.
- **System events** such as record creation, stage changes, status updates, and field modifications.
- **Task completions** related to this record.

Each timeline entry shows who performed the action and when it occurred, providing a complete audit trail of the relationship.

### Timeline on Different Record Types

| Record Type | What the Timeline Tracks |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Lead | All outreach attempts, status changes, scoring events, and notes |
| Contact | Calls, emails, meetings, notes, and deal-related activities |
| Account | All activities across every contact and deal at this account |
| Deal | Stage changes, buyer committee updates, quotes, calls, emails, meetings, and notes |

The account timeline is particularly valuable because it aggregates activities from all contacts and deals under that account, giving you a unified view of the entire customer relationship.

## Dashboard Action Items

The main dashboard includes an **Action Items** widget that surfaces your most important tasks and follow-ups. This widget shows:

- **Overdue tasks** -- Tasks past their due date that need immediate attention. These are highlighted to draw your focus.
- **Due today** -- Tasks that need to be completed today.
- **Upcoming tasks** -- Tasks due in the near future.

The action items widget pulls from your personal task list and prioritizes items by due date and priority level. It provides direct links to the associated records so you can take action quickly.

## How Activities Link to Records

Activities and tasks in SalesOS are linked to records through associations:

- **Lead activities** -- When you log an activity on a lead, it appears on that lead's timeline. If the lead is later converted, the activity history carries over to the new contact and account records.
- **Contact activities** -- Activities on contacts are visible on the contact detail page and also roll up to the associated account's timeline.
- **Deal activities** -- Activities logged on deals appear on the deal timeline and are also visible on the associated account's timeline.
- **Account activities** -- The account timeline is a master view that aggregates activities from all related contacts and deals.

A single task can be linked to one record (a lead, contact, or opportunity), and that linkage is shown as a clickable gold link on the task card.

## Notes on Records

Notes provide a freeform way to capture information that does not fit neatly into structured fields. You can add notes to leads, contacts, accounts, and deals.

### Adding Notes

Notes can be added from:

- The activity timeline on any record detail page.
- The Quick Log Activity feature on deal pages.

### What Notes Are Good For

- Recording key takeaways from a conversation.
- Documenting internal strategy or next steps.
- Capturing context that helps other team members understand the relationship.
- Logging competitive intelligence or objections heard during calls.

Notes are timestamped and attributed to the user who created them, making them a reliable part of the historical record.

## Best Practices for Activity Tracking

1. **Log activities immediately.** Record calls, meetings, and emails as soon as they happen, or as close to real time as possible. Delayed logging leads to forgotten details and incomplete records.

2. **Use the right activity type.** When logging an activity, select the correct type (Call, Email, Meeting, Note). This makes it easier to filter and analyze your engagement patterns later.

3. **Check your action items daily.** Start each day by reviewing the Action Items widget on your dashboard. Address overdue tasks first, then work through today's tasks.

4. **Set due dates on every task.** Tasks without due dates are easy to forget. Even if the date is approximate, having a deadline keeps the task visible in your action items.

5. **Use priorities meaningfully.** Reserve High priority for tasks that genuinely need immediate attention. If everything is high priority, nothing is.

6. **Link tasks to records.** Whenever possible, create tasks in context from a lead, contact, or deal page rather than creating standalone tasks. Linked tasks provide better context and appear on the related record's timeline.

7. **Write descriptive notes.** When adding notes to records, include enough context that a colleague (or your future self) can understand the situation without additional explanation. Mention names, dates, and specific outcomes.

8. **Review account timelines before meetings.** Before any call or meeting, check the activity timeline on the relevant account or contact to understand recent interactions. This prevents you from asking questions that have already been answered or missing important context.

9. **Keep tasks actionable.** A task subject should clearly describe what needs to be done. "Follow up with Jane about pricing" is better than "Follow up." The subject should make sense without needing to click through to the description.

10. **Clean up completed tasks regularly.** Review your completed tasks periodically to make sure nothing was marked done prematurely. The completed section should reflect genuinely finished work.
