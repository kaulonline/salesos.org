IRIS is the AI-powered sales assistant built into SalesOS. Powered by Claude, IRIS understands your CRM data and can help you with a wide range of sales tasks -- from analyzing your pipeline to drafting follow-up emails to preparing for upcoming meetings. IRIS is available from any page in SalesOS, making it a constant companion throughout your workday.

## What IRIS Is

IRIS stands for Intelligent Revenue Intelligence System. It is a conversational AI assistant that has access to your CRM data within SalesOS. Unlike a general-purpose chatbot, IRIS is purpose-built for sales workflows. It understands sales concepts like pipeline stages, win rates, deal velocity, and account health, and it can reason about your specific data to provide actionable recommendations.

IRIS is powered by Claude, Anthropic's AI model, and is designed to help you work faster and smarter without leaving the SalesOS platform.

## Accessing IRIS

There are two ways to access IRIS:

### AI Chat Page

Navigate to the IRIS chat interface through the **AI** menu in the main navigation. This opens a full-page chat experience with a conversation sidebar on the left and the main chat area on the right.

The full-page view is ideal for longer conversations, complex analyses, and tasks that require back-and-forth interaction.

### Quick Access

IRIS can also be accessed from the AI Features card on your Dashboard Home, which provides shortcuts to common AI capabilities.

## Example Prompts and Use Cases

Here are some specific prompts you can try, along with what IRIS will provide:

**"What deals are at risk this quarter?"**
IRIS will review your open deals, looking at factors like days since last activity, deal age relative to your typical cycle time, and probability trends. It will return a list of deals that show warning signs, along with specific reasons for the risk assessment.

**"Draft a follow-up email for [contact]"**
IRIS will look up the contact, review recent interactions and deal context, and draft a personalized follow-up email. You can ask it to adjust the tone, add specific points, or shorten the message.

**"Summarize my pipeline for this month"**
IRIS will provide a breakdown of your open deals by stage, total pipeline value, expected revenue, and notable changes since last month.

**"Help me prepare for my meeting with [account]"**
IRIS will compile relevant information about the account, including recent activities, open deals, key contacts, and any signals or alerts from AI Agents. It will suggest talking points and potential areas of discussion.

## How IRIS Uses Your CRM Data

IRIS has access to the data within your SalesOS account, including:

- **Deals** -- Names, amounts, stages, probabilities, close dates, and associated accounts
- **Leads and Contacts** -- Names, companies, engagement history, and scoring data
- **Activities** -- Calls, emails, meetings, and notes logged in the system
- **Accounts** -- Company information, health scores, and revenue data
- **Tasks** -- Your open and completed tasks
- **Meetings** -- Scheduled and past meetings

When you ask a question, IRIS queries your data in real time to provide answers that reflect the current state of your CRM. This means IRIS's answers are always based on live data, not stale snapshots.

## Privacy and Data Access

IRIS only accesses data that you have permission to view within SalesOS. Your conversations with IRIS are private to your account and are not visible to other users, including managers or administrators.

Key privacy details:

- IRIS does not share your conversation content with other SalesOS users
- IRIS does not access data from other organizations or tenants
- Your role-based permissions apply -- if you cannot see a deal or account in SalesOS, IRIS cannot see it either
- Conversation history is stored securely and can be deleted at any time

## Tips for Getting the Best Results from IRIS

1. **Be specific.** Instead of asking "How are my deals?", try "Which deals over $50K have not had activity in the last two weeks?" The more specific your question, the more useful the answer.

2. **Use names.** When asking about a specific deal, contact, or account, include the name. IRIS can look up entities by name to provide targeted answers.

3. **Ask follow-up questions.** IRIS maintains context within a conversation. If you ask about your pipeline and then say "Which of those deals is the largest?", IRIS will understand you are referring to the deals it just described.

4. **Request different formats.** You can ask IRIS to present information as a list, a summary, or a detailed analysis. For example: "Give me a bullet-point summary of my top 5 deals."

5. **Iterate on drafts.** When IRIS drafts an email or message for you, feel free to ask for revisions. "Make it shorter", "Add a mention of our new product", or "Make the tone more formal" are all valid follow-up requests.

6. **Use IRIS for meeting prep.** Before any important meeting, ask IRIS to prepare a briefing. This saves you time that would otherwise be spent manually reviewing deal histories, contact records, and recent activities.

7. **Verify important details.** IRIS is an AI assistant and may occasionally produce inaccurate information. For critical decisions, always verify the data IRIS provides by cross-referencing with the actual records in SalesOS. A disclaimer at the bottom of the chat interface reminds you of this.
