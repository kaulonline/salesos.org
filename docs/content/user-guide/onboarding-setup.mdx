title: Initial Setup & Onboarding
description: Get your SalesOS organization configured, invite your team, and start selling.
---

When you first log in to SalesOS, the platform guides you through a step-by-step onboarding wizard to configure your workspace. This page covers every stage of the setup process, from initial configuration through importing your data and connecting integrations.

## Onboarding Wizard

The onboarding wizard appears automatically the first time you log in. It walks you through five steps in a modal dialog with a progress bar at the top. You can navigate forward and backward between steps, or skip the wizard entirely if you prefer to configure things manually later.

### Step 1: Welcome

The welcome screen introduces SalesOS and highlights the three core capabilities of the platform:

- **Manage Contacts** -- Organize your relationships with leads, contacts, and accounts.
- **Track Deals** -- Visualize and manage your sales pipeline from prospecting through close.
- **AI Powered** -- Use built-in artificial intelligence to get insights, automate tasks, and receive deal recommendations.

Click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Tell Us About Your Business

This step collects information about your organization to tailor the SalesOS experience:

- **Industry** -- Select your industry from a dropdown list (Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Retail, Manufacturing, Professional Services, Real Estate, Education, or Other).
- **Team Size** -- Choose from predefined ranges: Just me, 2-10, 11-50, 51-200, or 200+.
- **Main Goals** -- Select one or more goals that describe what you want to accomplish:
  - Generate more leads
  - Close more deals
  - Automate workflows
  - Create quotes faster

SalesOS uses this information to prioritize relevant features and provide more targeted AI recommendations.

### Step 3: Key Features Overview

This step provides a brief tour of the four primary feature areas:

- **Contacts & Leads** -- Manage your contacts, track lead sources, and convert leads to opportunities.
- **Deals Pipeline** -- Visualize your sales pipeline with customizable stages and track deal progress.
- **Quotes & Orders** -- Create professional quotes, manage pricing, and convert to orders seamlessly.
- **AI Assistant** -- Get intelligent insights, automate tasks, and receive deal recommendations.

Review each feature card to understand what the platform offers, then continue to the next step.

### Step 4: Quick Start Actions

The quick start step presents actionable cards you can use to begin populating your workspace. You can choose any of the following or skip them and come back later:

- **Load Demo Data** -- Populate your workspace with sample contacts, deals, and activities so you can explore the platform with realistic data. This creates sample companies, contacts, leads, deals, activities, and tasks. Once loaded, the button shows a green checkmark confirming the demo data is in place.
- **Import Contacts** -- Navigate to the Contacts page to upload your existing contact data from a CSV file.
- **Invite Team Members** -- Navigate to the Team management page to add colleagues.
- **Connect Email** -- Navigate to the Integrations page to link your Gmail or Outlook account.
- **Connect Calendar** -- Navigate to the Integrations page to sync your Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar.

Selecting any of these actions (except Load Demo Data) will complete the wizard and take you directly to the relevant page.

### Step 5: All Done

The final step confirms your workspace is ready. From here you can go directly to the Dashboard to start working. The page also reminds you that you can press the **?** key at any time for quick help.

### Skipping or Resuming the Wizard

- Click the **X** button in the top-right corner of the wizard at any time to skip it.
- If you close the wizard partway through, your progress is saved. The wizard will resume from where you left off the next time you see it.
- Once the wizard is completed or skipped, it will not appear again automatically. To reset the onboarding experience (for example, when testing or training a new team member), clear the onboarding flag from your browser's local storage, or contact your administrator.

## Product Tour

After completing the onboarding wizard, SalesOS offers a guided product tour that highlights key areas of the interface. The tour uses spotlight-style overlays that dim the rest of the screen and focus on one element at a time.

### Tour Steps

The default product tour covers seven stops:

1. **Welcome to SalesOS** -- Introduces the tour and sets expectations (about one minute).
2. **Main Navigation** -- Highlights the pill-style navigation bar with Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities.
3. **Quick Search** -- Points to the search button and explains the Cmd+K / Ctrl+K shortcut.
4. **AI-Powered Features** -- Highlights the AI dropdown menu.
5. **Settings & Configuration** -- Highlights the Settings dropdown.
6. **Stay Updated** -- Points to the notification bell and explains how to customize notification preferences.
7. **You're All Set** -- Concludes the tour at the user avatar menu.

### Navigating the Tour

- Click **Next** to advance to the next step, or **Back** to revisit a previous step.
- Click **Skip tour** at any time to exit.
- A progress bar at the top of each tooltip shows how far through the tour you are.

### Re-Triggering the Product Tour

If you want to take the tour again at any time, click your **avatar** in the top-right corner of the navigation bar and select **Take a Tour**. This is especially useful when onboarding new team members who may have skipped the tour initially.

## Profile Setup

After completing onboarding, take a moment to fill out your user profile. A complete profile helps your team identify you and ensures system features like time-based reminders work correctly.

### Editing Your Profile

1. Click your **avatar** (initials icon) in the top-right corner of the navigation bar.
2. Your name, email, and role are displayed. To edit your full profile, navigate to **Settings > General Settings** or **Settings > Team** and locate your user entry.

### Profile Fields

- **First Name and Last Name** -- Displayed throughout SalesOS in activity logs, assignments, and notifications.
- **Avatar** -- Upload a profile photo. If no photo is uploaded, SalesOS displays your initials on a gold gradient background.
- **Email Address** -- Your login email, also used for notifications and email integration.
- **Timezone** -- Set your timezone so that meeting times, task due dates, and activity timestamps display correctly for you. This is especially important for teams distributed across multiple regions.
- **Notification Preferences** -- Control which events generate email notifications versus in-app notifications. Navigate to **Settings > Notifications** to configure these in detail.

## Connecting Email Integration

Linking your email account allows SalesOS to track email opens, log sent emails as activities on the relevant contact or deal, and sync your inbox for conversation tracking.

### Supported Email Providers

- **Gmail** (Google Workspace)
- **Outlook** (Microsoft 365)

### How to Connect

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** (or click "Connect Email" during the onboarding wizard).
2. Find the email integration card for your provider (Gmail or Outlook).
3. Click **Connect**.
4. You will be redirected to your email provider's authentication page. Sign in and grant SalesOS the requested permissions.
5. Once authorized, you will be redirected back to SalesOS with a confirmation message.

### What Email Integration Enables

- **Automatic Activity Logging** -- Emails sent to and received from known contacts are logged as activities on their record.
- **Email Tracking** -- Track when recipients open your emails and click links.
- **Send from SalesOS** -- Compose and send emails directly from a contact, lead, or deal record without switching to your email client.
- **Email Templates** -- Use your pre-built templates from the Email Templates section when composing messages.

## Connecting Calendar Integration

Calendar integration keeps your meetings in sync between SalesOS and your external calendar.

### Supported Calendar Providers

- **Google Calendar**
- **Outlook Calendar** (Microsoft 365)

### How to Connect

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** (or click "Connect Calendar" during the onboarding wizard).
2. Find the calendar integration card for your provider.
3. Click **Connect** and authenticate with your calendar provider.
4. Once connected, your existing calendar events will begin syncing to the SalesOS Calendar page.

### What Calendar Integration Enables

- **Two-Way Sync** -- Meetings created in SalesOS appear on your external calendar, and events created externally appear in SalesOS.
- **Meeting Logging** -- Meetings are automatically logged as activities on the associated contact or deal record.
- **Scheduling** -- Schedule meetings from within SalesOS and send calendar invitations directly.
- **Availability** -- See your team's availability when planning meetings.

## Importing Data via CSV

If you have existing lead, contact, or account data in spreadsheets or another CRM, you can import it into SalesOS using CSV files.

### Preparing Your CSV File

Before importing, ensure your CSV file meets these requirements:

- The file must be in **CSV format** (.csv). Excel files (.xlsx) should be exported as CSV first.
- The first row must contain **column headers** (for example: First Name, Last Name, Email, Company, Phone).
- Each subsequent row represents one record.
- Use **UTF-8 encoding** to ensure special characters import correctly.
- Remove any completely empty rows or columns.

### Supported Import Types

You can import three types of records:

- **Leads** -- Prospective contacts who have not yet been qualified.
- **Contacts** -- People you have an established relationship with.
- **Accounts** -- Companies or organizations.

### Starting an Import

1. Navigate to the relevant section (Leads, Contacts, or Accounts).
2. Look for an **Import** button in the page header or actions area.
3. Select your CSV file from your computer.
4. SalesOS will read the column headers and present the field mapping interface.

### Field Mapping

After uploading your file, you will see a field mapping screen where each column from your CSV is listed alongside a dropdown of SalesOS fields.

- SalesOS will attempt to **auto-match** common column names (for example, "Email" maps to the Email field, "Company" maps to the Company Name field).
- For columns that are not automatically matched, use the dropdown to select the correct SalesOS field, or choose **Skip this column** to ignore it.
- Required fields (such as Last Name for contacts, or Company Name for accounts) must be mapped for the import to proceed.
- If you have custom fields configured in SalesOS, those will appear in the dropdown list as well.

### Reviewing and Completing the Import

1. After mapping fields, SalesOS shows a preview of the first few records so you can verify the data looks correct.
2. If duplicates are detected (based on email address or company name), you will be prompted to choose whether to skip duplicates, update existing records, or create new records regardless.
3. Click **Import** to begin processing. Large files may take a few moments.
4. Once complete, you will see a summary showing how many records were created, updated, and skipped.

### Import Tips

- Start with a small test file (10-20 records) to verify your field mapping before importing your full dataset.
- Clean up your data before importing: remove duplicates, standardize formatting, and fill in missing required fields.
- If you need to import related data (for example, contacts that belong to specific accounts), import accounts first, then import contacts with a column that references the account name.

## Initial Pipeline Configuration

Your sales pipeline defines the stages that deals move through from initial qualification to close. SalesOS comes with a default pipeline, but you should customize it to match your actual sales process.

### Accessing Pipeline Settings

Navigate to **Settings > General Settings** or go to the Opportunities page and look for a pipeline configuration option.

### Recommended Pipeline Stages

A typical B2B pipeline includes these stages (customize to fit your process):

1. **Prospecting** -- Initial outreach and qualification.
2. **Discovery** -- Understanding the prospect's needs and pain points.
3. **Proposal** -- Presenting your solution and pricing.
4. **Negotiation** -- Working through terms, pricing adjustments, and legal review.
5. **Closed Won** -- Deal is signed and finalized.
6. **Closed Lost** -- Deal did not move forward.

### Configuration Tips

- Keep your pipeline to **5-7 stages**. Too many stages slow down your team; too few provide insufficient visibility.
- Define clear **exit criteria** for each stage so your team knows when a deal should advance.
- Set **default probability percentages** for each stage (for example, Discovery at 20%, Proposal at 50%, Negotiation at 75%). These are used by the forecasting engine.
- You can create **multiple pipelines** if your organization has distinct sales motions (for example, new business versus renewals, or different product lines).
