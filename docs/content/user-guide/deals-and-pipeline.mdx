title: Deals & Pipeline
description: Track sales opportunities through your pipeline from qualification to close.

Deals (also called opportunities) represent active sales engagements with a potential or existing customer. The pipeline is the visual representation of where each deal stands in your sales process. SalesOS provides both a Kanban board view and a list view for managing your deals, along with AI-powered insights to help you close more business.

## Pipeline Overview

Navigate to **Pipeline** from the left sidebar. The page header displays:

- **Total pipeline value** -- The sum of all deal amounts across all open stages.
- **Total opportunities** -- The number of active deals.

## Pipeline Selector

If your organization uses multiple pipelines (for example, separate pipelines for new business, renewals, and partnerships), use the **Pipeline Selector** dropdown at the top of the page to switch between them.

- Select a specific pipeline to view only deals in that pipeline.
- Select **All Pipelines** to see a combined view of all deals.
- The pipeline selector also includes a link to **Pipeline Settings** where administrators can configure stages and pipeline properties.

Each pipeline has its own set of stages with customizable names, colors, and probability percentages.

## Kanban Board View

The Kanban board is the default view for the pipeline page. It displays deals as cards organized into columns, where each column represents a stage or group of stages.

### How Columns Are Organized

SalesOS intelligently groups pipeline stages into Kanban columns:

- If your pipeline has three or fewer open stages, each stage gets its own column.
- If your pipeline has more stages, they are grouped by probability range:
  - **Discovery** -- Low probability stages (below 40%).
  - **Proposal** -- Mid-range probability stages (40% to 69%).
  - **Negotiation** -- High probability stages (70% and above).
- A **Closed Won** column always appears on the right side for won deals.

Each column header shows the stage name, a count of deals in that column, and the total value of those deals.

### Deal Cards

Each deal is displayed as a card on the Kanban board showing:

- **Account name** at the top.
- **Deal name** as the main title.
- **Stage badge** with the specific sub-stage name.
- **Deal amount** formatted as currency.
- **Probability percentage** indicating likelihood of close.
- **Owner avatar** in the bottom-right corner.
- A **progress bar** at the bottom that fills based on the deal's probability.

Click on any deal card to navigate to its detail page.

### Deal Card Actions

Click the **three-dot menu** on a deal card to access quick actions:

- **View Details** -- Navigate to the full deal detail page.
- **AI Analysis** -- Run an AI-powered analysis of the deal's health and next steps.
- **Mark Won** -- Close the deal as won (see Closing Deals below).
- **Mark Lost** -- Close the deal as lost with a required reason (see Closing Deals below).
- **Delete Opportunity** -- Permanently remove the deal.

### Adding Deals from the Kanban Board

Each column includes a dashed **Add Opportunity** button at the bottom. Click it to create a new deal that starts in that stage. You can also use the **+** button in the top toolbar.

## List View

Click the **list icon** in the view toggle (next to the grid icon) to switch to the list view. The list view displays deals in a tabular format with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Opportunity Name | Deal name and account name |
| Stage | Current stage with a color-coded badge |
| Value | Deal amount in currency format |
| Probability | A visual progress bar with percentage |
| Close Date | Expected close date |

Click on any row to navigate to the deal detail page.

## Filtering and Searching Deals

### Search

Use the **search bar** in the toolbar to find deals by opportunity name or account name.

### Stage Filter

Use the **All Stages** dropdown to filter deals by a specific Kanban column (Discovery, Proposal, Negotiation, or Closed Won).

### Probability Filter

Use the **All Probabilities** dropdown to show only deals above a certain probability threshold:

- All Probabilities (no filter)
- Greater than 25%
- Greater than 50%
- Greater than 75%

## Creating New Deals

Click the **+** button in the toolbar to open the New Opportunity form. Fill in:

- **Opportunity Name** (required) -- A descriptive name such as "Q1 Enterprise License - Acme Corp."
- **Account** (required) -- Select the company this deal is with.
- **Pipeline** -- If you have multiple active pipelines, select which one this deal belongs to. (Shown only when multiple pipelines exist.)
- **Amount** -- The expected deal value in dollars.
- **Stage** -- The initial stage for this deal. Only open stages (not Closed Won/Lost) are available.

Click **Create Opportunity** to save.

## Deal Detail Page

Click on any deal from the Kanban board or list view to open its detail page. The deal detail page provides a comprehensive view of the opportunity.

### Header

The header shows the deal name, current stage badge, deal amount, and probability. Action buttons let you:

- **Edit** the deal's information.
- **Advance Stage** to move the deal to the next stage.
- **Close Won** or **Close Lost**.
- **AI Analysis** to generate insights.

### Sidebar

The left sidebar shows a list of recently viewed deals for quick navigation.

### Accordion Sections

Expandable sections organize deal details:

- **Basic Information** -- Deal name, amount, probability, close date, stage, deal type (New Business, Existing Business, etc.), next steps, and needs analysis notes.
- **Additional details** as configured by your administrator.

### Buyer Committee

The deal detail page includes a **Buyer Committee** section showing all contacts associated with this opportunity. You can:

- View each contact's name, role, and title.
- Add contacts from the associated account.
- Remove contacts from the opportunity.
- Set a contact as the **primary contact** for this deal.

### Deal Charts

Visual charts display deal progression over time, probability trends, and other analytical data.

### AI Deal Analysis

- **Key insights** -- Observations about the deal based on activity patterns and data completeness.

### AI Email Drafts

The deal detail page includes an **AI Email Draft** button that generates personalized email drafts based on the deal context, stage, and related contacts.

### Integration Links

If the deal is linked to external systems (via integrations), external reference links and attachments are displayed on the detail page.

### Quick Log Activity

Use the **Quick Log Activity** feature on the deal detail page to quickly record calls, emails, meetings, and notes without leaving the page.

### Field Change History

An audit trail shows all changes made to the deal's fields, including who made each change and when.

## Moving Deals Between Stages

There are several ways to advance a deal through your pipeline:

1. **From the detail page** -- Click the **Advance Stage** button or edit the deal to change its stage.
2. **Edit the deal** -- Open the edit modal and select a new stage from the dropdown.
3. **Quick actions on Kanban** -- Use the three-dot menu to mark a deal as Won or Lost, which moves it to the respective closed stage.

When you change a deal's stage, its probability is automatically updated to match the new stage's default probability (as configured in pipeline settings).

## Stage Probability and Forecasting

Each pipeline stage has a default probability percentage that represents the statistical likelihood of a deal closing from that stage. For example:

- Prospecting: 10%
- Qualification: 20%
- Needs Analysis: 30%
- Value Proposition: 50%
- Proposal/Quote: 60%
- Negotiation: 80%
- Closed Won: 100%
- Closed Lost: 0%

These probabilities directly feed into your revenue forecasting. The **weighted pipeline value** is calculated as the sum of (deal amount x probability) across all open deals. You can override the probability on individual deals if a specific opportunity is stronger or weaker than the stage average.

## Closing Deals

### Marking a Deal as Won

To mark a deal as won:

1. Click the **three-dot menu** on the deal card and select **Mark Won**, or use the **Close Won** button on the deal detail page.
2. The deal is moved to the Closed Won stage with 100% probability.
3. A success confirmation is shown.

### Marking a Deal as Lost

To mark a deal as lost:

1. Click the **three-dot menu** on the deal card and select **Mark Lost**, or use the **Close Lost** button on the deal detail page.
2. A modal appears asking for a **Reason for Loss** (required). Enter a clear reason such as "Lost to competitor," "Budget constraints," or "Timing not right."
3. Click **Mark as Lost** to confirm.
4. The deal moves to the Closed Lost stage with 0% probability.

Tracking loss reasons helps your team identify patterns and improve your sales process over time.

## Pipeline Summary Metrics

The pipeline page header shows real-time summary metrics:

- **Total Value** -- Sum of all deal amounts in the current view.
- **Total Opportunities** -- Count of deals in the current view.

Each Kanban column also shows its own count and total value, giving you a quick snapshot of where your pipeline weight is concentrated.

## Deleting Deals

To delete a deal, use the **three-dot menu** on the deal card and select **Delete Opportunity**. A confirmation modal will ask you to verify the deletion. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

## Best Practices for Pipeline Management

1. **Keep your pipeline current.** Update deal stages and amounts weekly. A stale pipeline leads to inaccurate forecasts and missed follow-ups.

2. **Use realistic amounts.** Enter the actual expected contract value, not aspirational numbers. Overstating deal amounts inflates your forecast and erodes trust in the data.

3. **Set close dates and update them.** Every deal should have an expected close date. If a deal slips, update the close date rather than leaving it in the past.

4. **Track loss reasons consistently.** When closing deals as lost, provide specific, honest reasons. Over time, loss reason data reveals patterns that can improve your sales strategy.

5. **Leverage AI analysis.** Run AI analysis on important deals to surface risks you may have missed. The AI can identify gaps in your engagement, buyer committee coverage, and deal progression.

6. **Fill in the buyer committee.** Adding contacts to deals and assigning roles (Champion, Decision Maker, Economic Buyer) gives you a clear picture of whether you have the right relationships to close.

7. **Review pipeline in both views.** Use the Kanban board for a visual overview and the list view for detailed analysis. Each view highlights different aspects of your pipeline.

8. **Use multiple pipelines when appropriate.** If your sales process differs for new business vs. renewals vs. partnerships, set up separate pipelines with their own stages rather than forcing everything into one.
