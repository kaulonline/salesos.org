## Email Templates

### Accessing Email Templates

Navigate to **Email Templates** from the left sidebar. The Email Templates page displays all your templates in a searchable, filterable grid layout.

### Template Statistics

At the top of the page, four summary cards provide an overview of your template library:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Templates** | The total number of templates in your organization |
| **Active** | Templates that are currently enabled for use |
| **Shared** | Templates shared with the entire team |
| **Most Used** | The usage count of your most popular template |

### Browsing and Searching Templates

Templates are displayed as cards in a responsive grid. Each card shows:

- **Category badge** -- The template's category with a color-coded label.
- **Shared indicator** -- A people icon if the template is shared with the team.
- **Active/Inactive status** -- An "Inactive" badge if the template has been deactivated.
- **Template name** -- The display name of the template.
- **Subject line** -- A preview of the email subject.
- **Body preview** -- A truncated preview of the email body content.
- **Usage count** -- How many times the template has been used.

Use the **search bar** to find templates by name or subject line. Use the **category dropdown** to filter templates by their assigned category.

### Template Categories

Templates can be organized into the following categories:

| Category | Label | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `SALES` | Sales Outreach | Initial prospecting and cold outreach emails |
| `FOLLOW_UP` | Follow Up | Post-meeting or post-demo follow-up messages |
| `QUOTE` | Quote & Proposal | Sending quotes, proposals, and pricing information |
| `MEETING` | Meeting | Meeting invitations, confirmations, and reminders |
| `ONBOARDING` | Onboarding | Welcome emails and onboarding sequences for new customers |
| `NURTURING` | Lead Nurturing | Long-term nurture emails to keep prospects engaged |
| `ANNOUNCEMENT` | Announcement | Product updates, company news, and announcements |
| `CUSTOM` | Custom | Any template that does not fit the predefined categories |

### Creating an Email Template

Click the **New Template** button to open the template creation modal. Fill in the following fields:

#### Template Name (required)
A descriptive internal name for the template (e.g., "Welcome Email" or "Post-Demo Follow Up"). This name is not visible to email recipients.

#### Category
Select a category from the dropdown to organize the template. Defaults to "Custom" if not specified.

#### Subject Line (required)
The email subject line. You can include merge fields in the subject to personalize it dynamically (e.g., `Hello {{contact.firstName}}!`).

#### Email Body (required)
The main content of the email. The body editor supports rich text and merge fields. Write your email content and insert merge fields where you want personalized data to appear.

#### Share with Team
Check this option to make the template available to all users in your organization. Unshared templates are only visible to the creator.

### Using Merge Fields

Merge fields are dynamic placeholders that get replaced with actual data when the email is sent. To insert a merge field:

1. Place your cursor in the body editor where you want the field to appear.
2. Click the **Merge Field** button above the editor.
3. Select the field you want to insert from the dropdown menu.

Available merge fields include:

| Merge Field | Description | Example Value |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `{{contact.firstName}}` | Contact's first name | John |
| `{{contact.lastName}}` | Contact's last name | Smith |
| `{{contact.email}}` | Contact's email address | john.smith@example.com |
| `{{contact.phone}}` | Contact's phone number | +1 (555) 123-4567 |
| `{{contact.company}}` | Contact's company name | Acme Corporation |
| `{{account.name}}` | Account name | Acme Corporation |
| `{{account.website}}` | Account website | www.acme.com |
| `{{opportunity.name}}` | Opportunity/deal name | Enterprise Deal Q1 |
| `{{opportunity.amount}}` | Deal amount | $50,000 |
| `{{user.name}}` | Your name (the sender) | Sarah Johnson |
| `{{user.email}}` | Your email address | sarah@company.com |
| `{{user.phone}}` | Your phone number | +1 (555) 987-6543 |
| `{{lead.firstName}}` | Lead's first name | Mike |
| `{{lead.lastName}}` | Lead's last name | Johnson |
| `{{lead.company}}` | Lead's company | Startup Inc |
| `{{lead.email}}` | Lead's email address | mike@startup.io |

### Previewing Templates

When editing a template, switch to the **Preview** tab to see how the email will look with merge fields replaced by sample data. The preview shows:

- The rendered subject line with sample values.
- The full email body with all merge fields replaced.
- A reference table showing which sample values were used.

This helps you verify that your merge fields are placed correctly and that the email reads naturally before sending it to real recipients.

### Creating Templates with AI

Click the **Create with AI** button to open the AI Builder modal. Describe the type of email you want to create, and SalesOS will generate a complete template including the name, subject line, body content, and category. You can review and edit the AI-generated template before saving it.

### Editing Templates

Click the **edit icon** (pencil) on any template card to open the Edit Template modal. The edit modal provides the same fields as the create modal plus the Preview tab. Make your changes and click **Save Changes**.

### Cloning Templates

Click the **clone icon** (copy) on a template card to create a duplicate. The cloned template is named with a "(Copy)" suffix and can be edited independently. This is useful when you want to create a variation of an existing template without starting from scratch.

### Activating and Deactivating Templates

Click the **toggle icon** on a template card to activate or deactivate it. Deactivated templates remain in your library but are not available for selection when composing emails. This is useful for seasonal templates or templates that are under revision.

### Deleting Templates

Click the **delete icon** (trash can) on a template card. A confirmation dialog will ask you to confirm the deletion. Deleted templates cannot be recovered, so exercise caution. The confirmation dialog displays the template name to help you verify you are deleting the correct one.

### Using Templates When Composing Emails

When composing an email from a lead or contact record, you can select a template to pre-fill the subject line and body. The merge fields in the template are automatically replaced with the actual data from the lead or contact record, saving you time and ensuring consistency.

## Campaigns

### Filtering and Searching Campaigns

- **Type dropdown** -- Filter by campaign type (Email, Webinar, Conference, etc.).
- **Status dropdown** -- Filter by campaign status (Planned, In Progress, Paused, Completed, Aborted).

Filters can be combined. For example, you can search for "Product Launch" while filtering to only show Email campaigns that are In Progress.

### Campaign Members

Campaign members are the leads and contacts enrolled in a campaign. Each member record tracks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Lead or Contact** | The associated lead or contact record |
| **Status** | The member's engagement status: Sent, Responded, Converted, or Opted Out |
| **First Responded Date** | When the member first engaged with the campaign |
| **Has Responded** | Whether the member has responded at all |

Adding leads and contacts to campaigns allows you to track which campaigns are generating engagement and ultimately driving conversions.

### Campaign Metrics and Attribution

SalesOS tracks the following metrics for each campaign to measure effectiveness:

- **Number Sent** -- How many messages or touches were sent.
- **Number of Leads** -- Total leads attributed to the campaign.
- **Number of Contacts** -- Total contacts associated with the campaign.
- **Number of Opportunities** -- Deals generated from the campaign.
- **Number of Converted Leads** -- Leads that were converted to contacts/opportunities.
- **Amount All Opportunities** -- Total pipeline value from campaign-generated opportunities.
- **Amount Won Opportunities** -- Revenue from closed-won deals attributed to the campaign.
- **ROI** -- Return on investment based on actual cost and won revenue.
- **Cost Per Lead** -- Average cost to acquire a lead through this campaign.
- **Conversion Rate** -- Percentage of leads that converted.

#### Lead Attribution

When a lead is generated through a campaign, SalesOS tracks the campaign source on the lead record. This attribution persists through the lead lifecycle, so when the lead converts to a contact and generates an opportunity, the originating campaign receives credit for the revenue.

## Best Practices

### Email Template Best Practices

#### Personalize with merge fields
Always use merge fields for the recipient's name, company, and other relevant details. Personalized emails see significantly higher engagement rates than generic messages.

#### Organize templates by category
Use the category system to keep your template library organized. This makes it easy for team members to find the right template quickly.

#### Share high-performing templates
When a template performs well, mark it as shared so your entire team can benefit. Track usage counts to identify which templates resonate best.

#### Preview before sending
Always use the Preview tab to verify that merge fields render correctly and that the email reads naturally with sample data.

#### Keep templates up to date
Regularly review and update your templates. Deactivate outdated templates rather than deleting them, in case you need to reference them later.

#### Use AI to jumpstart creation
If you are starting from scratch, use the AI Builder to generate a first draft. Then customize the AI-generated content to match your voice and specific use case.

### Campaign Management Best Practices

#### Set clear objectives
Before creating a campaign, define what success looks like. Set realistic budget and expected revenue numbers so you can measure ROI accurately.

#### Track all channels
Create campaigns for every marketing channel you use, including events, content, and partner activities. Comprehensive tracking gives you a full picture of what drives leads and revenue.

#### Monitor budget utilization
Use the budget progress bar to keep spending on track. If a campaign is underspending, consider reallocating budget to higher-performing campaigns.

#### Review ROI regularly
Check the ROI metric on each campaign to understand which campaign types and channels deliver the best return. Use this data to inform future campaign planning.

#### Link leads to campaigns
Always associate new leads with their source campaign. This ensures accurate attribution and helps you understand which campaigns are generating the most valuable leads.

#### Use status transitions thoughtfully
Move campaigns through statuses (Planned, In Progress, Paused, Completed, Aborted) to maintain an accurate view of your active marketing efforts. Pausing a campaign is preferable to aborting it if you plan to resume later.
