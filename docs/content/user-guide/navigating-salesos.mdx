SalesOS is designed around a clean, streamlined interface that keeps the most important areas of your CRM within easy reach. This guide covers every aspect of the navigation system so you can move through the platform quickly and efficiently.

## Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar is fixed at the top of the screen and remains visible as you scroll. It contains the SalesOS logo, main navigation pills, and action buttons on the right side.

### Primary Navigation Pills

The center of the header features a pill-style navigation bar with rounded, tab-like buttons. The five primary areas of SalesOS are always visible here:

- **Dashboard** -- Your home base with pipeline overview, metrics, upcoming activities, and AI-generated insights.
- **Leads** -- Manage inbound and outbound leads before they become qualified opportunities.
- **Contacts** -- Your database of individual people you do business with.
- **Accounts** -- Companies and organizations, each linked to their associated contacts, deals, and activities.
- **Opportunities** -- Active deals in your pipeline, displayed on a Kanban board or list view.

The currently active section is highlighted with a dark pill (white text on a dark background). Inactive items appear in muted text and highlight on hover. Clicking any pill navigates you directly to that section.

## The "More" Dropdown Menu

To the right of the primary navigation pills, you will find a **More** button with a chevron arrow. Clicking it reveals a dropdown menu organized into three categories with section headers.

### Sales

Items under the Sales header give you access to your quote-to-cash workflow and competitive tracking:

- **Products** -- Your product catalog with SKUs, descriptions, and pricing.
- **Quotes** -- Configure, price, and quote (CPQ) with line items, discounts, and approval workflows.
- **Orders** -- Track orders from creation through fulfillment.
- **CPQ Analytics** -- Performance metrics for your quoting process.
- **Competitors** -- Track competitive intelligence and win/loss reasons.
- **Assets** -- Manage customer assets, serial numbers, and license keys.
- **Partners** -- Partner relationship management with tiers and tracking.

### Analytics

Items under the Analytics header provide reporting and forecasting tools:

- **Analytics** -- General sales analytics and performance dashboards.
- **Revenue** -- Revenue tracking and trend analysis.
- **Forecast** -- Pipeline forecasting with AI-assisted predictions.
- **Win/Loss** -- Analyze why deals were won or lost to improve your process.
- **Account Health** -- Monitor account engagement and risk signals.

### Productivity

Items under the Productivity header help you stay organized and execute outreach:

- **Calendar** -- View and manage meetings, synced with Google Calendar or Outlook.
- **Messages** -- Internal messaging and communication.
- **Campaigns** -- Multi-step outreach campaigns targeting lists of leads or contacts.
- **Email Templates** -- Reusable email templates with merge fields for personalized outreach.
- **Territories** -- Geographic or account-based territory management.
- **Playbooks** -- Guided selling sequences with automated steps and reminders.

When any item inside the More dropdown is active (you are on that page), the More button itself turns dark to indicate you are in one of its sub-sections.

### Customizing the More Menu

The items visible in the More dropdown can be customized per user. Navigate to **Settings > Menu Customization** to show or hide entire categories or individual items. This is helpful if your team does not use certain features and you want a cleaner navigation experience. You can reset to defaults at any time.

## AI Menu

To the right of the More dropdown, the **AI** button (marked with a brain icon) opens a dedicated dropdown for SalesOS's artificial intelligence features:

- **AI Agents** -- Autonomous agents that monitor deal health, provide coaching suggestions, and surface actionable insights.
- **AI Alerts** -- Intelligent alerts about risks, opportunities, and anomalies across your pipeline.
- **Conversations** -- Conversation intelligence powered by call recording analysis, including talk-to-listen ratios, sentiment, and key moments.
- **Knowledge Base** -- Your organization's shared knowledge repository, used by AI features to provide contextual answers.

When any AI page is active, the AI button displays with a gold gradient background.

## Settings Menu

The **Settings** button (gear icon) opens a dropdown organized into logical sections:

### Organization
- **General Settings** -- Organization name, branding, fiscal year, and default preferences.
- **Team** -- Manage users, invite new members, and assign roles.
- **Subscription** -- View and manage your SalesOS plan and billing.

### Workflow
- **Automations** -- Create trigger-based workflows that fire when records are created or updated.
- **Approval Workflows** -- Define multi-step approval chains for quotes, discounts, and other processes.
- **Assignment Rules** -- Configure lead and opportunity routing rules.

### Data
- **Custom Fields** -- Add custom fields to leads, contacts, accounts, and opportunities.
- **Web Forms** -- Create embeddable forms for your website that feed directly into SalesOS.
- **Integrations** -- Connect third-party tools like email providers, calendar apps, and marketing platforms.
- **Reports** -- Build and manage custom reports.

### Security
- **Profiles & Roles** -- Define role-based access and field-level permissions.
- **Security** -- Two-factor authentication, session management, and password policies.
- **Data & Privacy** -- Data retention, export, and GDPR compliance settings.
- **Notifications** -- Configure which events trigger email or in-app notifications.
- **API & Webhooks** -- Manage API keys and webhook endpoints for integrations.

### Admin (Admins Only)
If your account has the Admin role, two additional items appear:
- **Admin Console** -- System-wide configuration and user management.
- **Billing Admin** -- Detailed billing administration and invoice history.

## Command Palette

Press **Cmd+K** (macOS) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) from anywhere in SalesOS to open the command palette. This is the fastest way to navigate the platform.

### How It Works

The command palette appears as a centered overlay with a search input. Start typing to filter through available actions:

- **Manage Agents** -- Jump to the AI Agents page.
- **Knowledge Base** -- Jump to the Knowledge Base.
- **Go to Leads** -- Navigate to the Leads list.
- **Go to Opportunities** -- Navigate to the Opportunities pipeline.
- **View Calendar** -- Open the Calendar page.
- **Search Documents** -- Navigate to the Documents section.

### Keyboard Navigation Within the Command Palette

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Up/Down arrows | Move through the list of suggestions |
| Enter | Execute the selected action |
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Move forward / backward through suggestions |
| Escape | Close the command palette |

The command palette filters results in real time as you type. If no actions match your query, you will see a "No results found" message.

## Global Search

Click the **Search** button in the top-right area of the navigation bar (or press **Cmd+K** / **Ctrl+K**) to open the global search modal. While the command palette is for quick actions and navigation, the global search is a full-text search across all your data.

### What Global Search Covers

Global search queries the following record types simultaneously:

- Leads
- Contacts
- Accounts (Companies)
- Opportunities (Deals)
- Products
- Campaigns
- Tasks
- Meetings
- Quotes
- Orders
- Partners
- Competitors
- Assets
- Territories

Results are grouped by type with color-coded icons, making it easy to identify the kind of record you are looking at.

### Using Global Search

1. Open the search modal by clicking the Search button or pressing Cmd+K / Ctrl+K.
2. Type your search term. Results appear in real time after a brief debounce delay.
3. Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to navigate through results.
4. Press **Enter** to open the selected record, or click directly on a result.
5. Press **Escape** to close the search modal.

### Recent Searches

When you open global search with an empty query, your five most recent searches are displayed for quick re-use. Click any recent search to re-run it.

## Notifications and Alerts

The top navigation bar includes two notification areas on the right side:

- **Alerts** (bell with exclamation icon) -- System-level alerts and AI-generated warnings about pipeline risks or account changes.
- **Notifications** (bell icon) -- Activity notifications such as task reminders, deal updates, mentions, and assignment changes.

Click either icon to open a dropdown showing your latest items. Configure which events generate notifications under **Settings > Notifications**.

## User Menu

Your avatar (showing your initials) appears at the far right of the navigation bar. Click it to open the user menu, which displays:

- Your name, email, and role badge.
- **Admin Console** (visible only if you have the Admin role).
- **Take a Tour** -- Re-launch the guided product tour at any time.
- **Sign out** -- End your session and return to the login page.

## Floating AI Chat

A floating chat button appears in the bottom-right corner of every page. Click it to open the IRIS AI Assistant in a chat window without leaving your current page. You can ask questions, request deal summaries, get coaching tips, or ask IRIS to help draft emails. The chat window can be expanded to a larger size or minimized.

## Mobile and Responsive Navigation

On smaller screens (tablets and mobile devices), the navigation adapts automatically:

### Mobile Hamburger Menu

The pill navigation and dropdown menus are hidden on small screens. Instead, a **hamburger menu** icon appears in the top-right corner. Tapping it opens a full-screen dark navigation drawer that slides in from the top.

The mobile drawer contains all navigation items organized in the same logical groups:

1. **Primary navigation** -- Dashboard, Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities.
2. **Sales, Analytics, and Productivity** sections from the More menu.
3. **AI** section with all AI features.
4. **Settings** section with all configuration pages.
5. **User info and Sign out** at the bottom.

Active items are highlighted with a subtle white background, and section headers appear as small uppercase labels.

### Responsive Behavior

- The Search button shows only an icon on small screens, with the label and keyboard shortcut hidden.
- The AI and Settings dropdowns are hidden on mobile and consolidated into the hamburger drawer.
- Notification icons remain accessible on all screen sizes.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

SalesOS supports keyboard shortcuts for power users:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Cmd+K / Ctrl+K | Open the command palette or global search |
| Escape | Close any open modal, dropdown, or overlay |
| Up/Down arrows | Navigate within dropdowns, search results, and command palette |
| Enter | Select the highlighted item in any list |
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Cycle through command palette suggestions |

## Tips for Efficient Navigation

- **Pin your most-used pages**: Use the command palette (Cmd+K) as a quick launcher rather than clicking through menus.
- **Customize your More menu**: Hide features your team does not use to reduce clutter. Go to Settings > Menu Customization.
- **Use global search for records**: If you know a contact name, deal name, or account, global search is faster than navigating to the list and filtering.
- **Re-take the product tour**: If you are onboarding a new team member or want a refresher, click your avatar and select "Take a Tour" to walk through the interface highlights.
- **Watch for the active state**: The dark pill highlight on navigation items always tells you where you are in the application. The More, AI, and Settings buttons also change appearance when you are on a page within their sections.
