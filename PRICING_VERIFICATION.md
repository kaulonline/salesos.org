# Competitor Pricing Verification - Real Market Data (2024-2025)

## CRITICAL: Current Pages Have Inflated/Incorrect Pricing

### HubSpot (NEEDS MAJOR CORRECTION)
**Current Claim**: $450/user/month base
**REAL Pricing**:
- Sales Hub Professional: **$90/user/month** (5-user minimum = $450/month total)
- Sales Hub Enterprise: $150/user/month
- Breeze AI: Not separately priced, included in tiers
- Marketing Hub Professional: $800/month (not per user, team pricing)

**Issue**: Page confuses $450 TOTAL (5 users) with $450 PER USER. This is 5x inflated!

### Salesforce (NEEDS CORRECTION)
**Current Claims**: Various claims about $25/user base
**REAL Pricing**:
- Sales Cloud Starter: $25/user/month
- Sales Cloud Professional: $80/user/month
- Sales Cloud Enterprise: $165/user/month
- Sales Cloud Unlimited: $330/user/month
- Einstein AI: +$50/user/month minimum

**Issue**: Implementation costs ($50k-$500k) may be exaggerated for small teams

### Pipedrive (MOSTLY ACCURATE)
**Current Claim**: $119 Enterprise + add-ons
**REAL Pricing**:
- Essential: $14/user/month
- Advanced: $34/user/month
- Professional: $49/user/month
- Power: $64/user/month
- Enterprise: $99/user/month (NOT $119)
- LeadBooster: $39/company/month
- Web Visitors: $49/company/month

**Issue**: Enterprise is $99 not $119, add-ons are per company not per user

### Zoho CRM (MOSTLY ACCURATE)
**Current Claims**: $52 Ultimate + add-ons
**REAL Pricing**:
- Standard: $14/user/month
- Professional: $23/user/month
- Enterprise: $40/user/month
- Ultimate: $52/user/month ✓ CORRECT
- Zoho Analytics: $45/user/month ✓ CORRECT
- Zoho Campaigns: Starts at $6/month (up to 500 contacts, not per user)

**Issue**: Campaigns pricing is per organization, not per user

### Monday.com (NEEDS CORRECTION)
**Current Claim**: $99-129/user for CRM
**REAL Pricing**:
- Basic: $9/user/month
- Standard: $12/user/month
- Pro: $19/user/month (NOT $99)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing
- Monday Sales CRM: Add-on, not separately priced in 2025

**Issue**: Completely wrong - Pro is $19/user not $99/user!

### SalesOS (UNVERIFIED - THIS IS THE CLIENT'S PRODUCT)
**Current Claim**: $99/user/month
**Status**: UNKNOWN - Need to verify with client what real pricing is
- Is it actually $99/user/month?
- Or is it outcome-based (2.5% of revenue)?
- Or is it different pricing tiers?

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **URGENT**: Fix HubSpot pricing ($90/user not $450/user)
2. **URGENT**: Fix Monday.com pricing ($19/user Pro, not $99)
3. **Fix**: Correct Pipedrive Enterprise ($99 not $119)
4. **Clarify**: Make clear when costs are "per company" vs "per user"
5. **Verify**: Get real SalesOS pricing from client
6. **Soften**: Use "starting at" language for estimates
7. **Disclaimer**: Add note that pricing is approximate and changes

## Sources Needed
- Official competitor pricing pages (as of Feb 2025)
- G2/Capterra reviews for implementation costs
- Industry reports for adoption rates
- Real customer case studies for testimonials

## Statistics That Need Verification
- "92% adoption rate" for SalesOS - made up, no product exists yet
- "37% adoption rate" for Salesforce - needs source
- "42% adoption rate" for HubSpot - needs source
- "38% adoption rate" for Zoho - needs source
- Customer testimonial quotes - all fabricated, need real ones or remove

## ACTION ITEMS
1. Update all 5 comparison pages with correct pricing
2. Add disclaimers about pricing being approximate
3. Replace fabricated statistics with general claims
4. Remove or clearly mark fictional customer testimonials
5. Use "example" language when showing cost calculations
